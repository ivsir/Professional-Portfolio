# Professional-Portfolio
Module 2 Challenge
## Description
I was assigned a project in which I had to create a Professional Portfolio using HTML and CSS. It contained various links to my contact information and serves as a landing page for my class projects. So far, it only contains one project, but it will serve as the basis for my future Professional Portfolio.
